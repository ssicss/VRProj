For Ubuntu 13:

1.) Install open-ocd, follow the steps on:

(only the ones related to open-ocd)


2.) Connect the STM32F3DISCOERY board to the PC on its USB ST-LINK connector


3.) In a terminal, run this:

sudo openocd -f /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/board/stm32f3discovery.cfg -c init -c"reset halt" -c"flash erase_sector 0 0 127" -c"flash write_image stm32f3_HID_for_real.elf"

The firmware should be programmed. If everything goes well, you can connect the board on the USB USER connector and it should be recognized as: "Oculus VR, Inc. Tracker DK"
